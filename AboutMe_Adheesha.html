            My name is Adheesha Chamod.
            I'm 23 years old.
            I live in a village called Rathgama, and it is located in the Galle district.
            I studied at Mahinda College from grade 1 to 13.
            It is a famous boy's school in the Galle district.
            After my A/L's, I followed a Java course called CMJD in IJSE.
            Now, I'm a 2nd year undergraduate at the University of Colombo School of Computing(UCSC).
            Currently, I follow the computer science degree program there.

            There are four members in my family. Father, mother, younger brother, and myself. 
            My father worked at a government-related board called National Dangerous Drugs Control Board and my mother was a English teacher. 
            Now they are retired. 
            My brother is 4 years younger than me, and he is a student at the same school where I studied. 
            He faces the GCE A/L examination this year from the science stream.
