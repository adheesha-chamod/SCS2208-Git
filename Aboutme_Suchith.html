    Hi! 
    My name is Suchith. 
    I am 22 years old.
    I am from Ganegoda, a village situated in Galle District,Southern Province.
    I did my studies at Richmond College and now I am studing Computer Science in University of Colombo, School 
    of Computing and now I am studing as a second year undergraduate. 
    My ambition is to be a good Software Engineer and to be a valuable person to my 
    country.
    My hobbies watching cricket matches, collecting stamps, spend time with my fish, etc. 
</br>
    There are three members in my family. They are me, my mother and my sister.
    Unfortunately, my father died several years ago. That is still a sad thing to me to 
    remember. But my mother's love and affetcion doesn't keep us worring about it. 
    My mother is a Nursing Officer. She works at Karapitiya teaching hospital. 
    My sister is 18 years old and she is willing to sit for the GCE A/L examination at the
    end of this year. 
    I and my sister have a pet dog. Her name is Lissy. We spend most of the time with her
    by playing and caring about her. She is so lovely to us.
