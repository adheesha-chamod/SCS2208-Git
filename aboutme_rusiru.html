    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <h2> Welcome! </h2>
	<p> Every person has their own unique story. Here is a glimpse into mine.</p>
	<p>My name is Rusiru Rathmina. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Colombo School of Computing. I was born on 11<sup>th</sup> October 1999. 
        I live in Baddegama, Galle. I had my primary education at Christ Church Boys' College, Baddegama 
        and my secondary education at Mahinda College, Galle. My father is a retired technician and my mother is the General Manager of 
        Baddegama East Sanasa Bank. I have a brother who is two years younger than me.</p>
    <p>I like to read books and comics in my free time. Also, watch movies and TV series. I like to eat spicy foods and street foods are my favourites.
        My favourite colour is black. I prefer simple clothes.</p>
